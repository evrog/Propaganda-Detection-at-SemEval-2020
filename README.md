# Propaganda-Detection-at-SemEval-2020

The project describes a fast solution to propaganda detection at SemEval-2020 Task 11, based onfeature adjustment. We use per-token vectorization of features and a simple Logistic Regression Classifier to quickly test different hypotheses about our data. The result of our system at SemEval2020 Task 11 is F-score=0.37.
